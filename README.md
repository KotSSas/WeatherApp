## Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Edit one or more files in `src/`. Be sure to include the `description` field if relevant.
3. Run `yarn build` then `yarn test`
4. Commit your changes including `presets.json`, push to GitHub, and raise a PR

Once PRs are committed to `master`, they are effectively "live" - there is no publish step.
